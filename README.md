# Assignment 6

For assignment 6 you will be creating a program with multiple classes for the first time. This particular program manipulates integers in a few ways which include:

1. Getting the sum of the digits
2. Getting the nth digit
3. Reversing the digits

You will also need some helper methods for achieving these tasks and some basic getters and setters.

## Part 1

Get the classes set up in BlueJ, create instance variables, create a constructor, and fill in some methods together.

## Part 2

Complete the `stop`, `getNthDigit`, and `runCompleted` methods.

## Part 3

Complete the `getReverse` and `getDigitSum` methods.

## Sample Outputs

```
Welcome to the Number Manipulator program!
Enter an integer: 961
Enter '1' to reverse, '2' for sum, '3' for a digit, '4' to change the number: 1
Your value is 169
You have manipulated 961 a total of 1 times.
Would you like to keep going? (y/N) y
Would you like to change your number? (y/N) n
Enter '1' to reverse, '2' for sum, '3' for a digit, '4' to change the number: 2
Your value is 16
You have manipulated 961 a total of 2 times.
Would you like to keep going? (y/N) y
Would you like to change your number? (y/N) y
Enter a new integer: 668
Enter '1' to reverse, '2' for sum, '3' for a digit, '4' to change the number: 3
Which digit do you want? 3
Your value is 8
You have manipulated 668 a total of 1 times.
Would you like to keep going? (y/N) y
Would you like to change your number? (y/N) n
Enter '1' to reverse, '2' for sum, '3' for a digit, '4' to change the number: 1
Your value is 866
You have manipulated 668 a total of 2 times.
Would you like to keep going? (y/N) n
```

### Grading

As always, your program will be graded on its functionality according to the project specifications and proper code style.
